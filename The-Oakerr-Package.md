`oak/oakerr` is a subpackage which enumerates over several standardized error types. 

The eventual goal of this package is that all error messages that oak reports will be some type of error here, both so that users can properly check if their errors match specific types, and so error messages can be reported and standardized in multiple languages in one place.
